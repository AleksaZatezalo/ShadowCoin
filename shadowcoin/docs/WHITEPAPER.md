# ShadowCoin: A Privacy-Preserving Cryptocurrency with Accessible Mining

**Version 1.0**  
**September 2025**

**Abstract**: We present ShadowCoin, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that combines ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions to provide strong anonymity guarantees while maintaining an accessible, CPU-friendly mining algorithm. Unlike existing privacy coins that require specialized hardware or significant computational resources, ShadowCoin prioritizes decentralization through a modified RandomX algorithm with reduced memory requirements. The system employs MLSAG ring signatures for sender anonymity, stealth addresses for receiver privacy, and Bulletproofs for amount confidentiality, all while maintaining a fixed supply cap of 100 million coins.

### 1.1 Motivation

The emergence of blockchain technology has enabled peer-to-peer electronic cash systems without trusted intermediaries. However, most cryptocurrencies provide only pseudonymity, not true privacy. Transaction graphs are publicly visible, allowing sophisticated analysis to link addresses, track funds, and compromise user privacy.

Privacy is not merely a feature but a fundamental requirement for fungible digital cash. Without privacy:
- Transaction history can be traced indefinitely
- Users face discrimination based on transaction history
- Commercial activities are exposed to competitors
- Financial privacy becomes impossible

Existing privacy solutions face two key challenges:

1. **Complexity**: Privacy mechanisms often require significant computational overhead
2. **Centralization**: Heavy mining algorithms favor large-scale operations with specialized hardware

ShadowCoin addresses both challenges by providing robust cryptographic privacy with an accessible mining algorithm.

### 1.2 Design Principles

ShadowCoin is built on four core principles:

1. **Privacy by Default**: All transactions are private without user intervention
2. **Decentralization**: Mining remains accessible to commodity hardware
3. **Fungibility**: All coins are indistinguishable and equally valuable
4. **Sustainability**: Fixed supply with predictable emission schedule

### 1.3 Contributions

This paper presents:
- A complete privacy-preserving cryptocurrency protocol
- Integration of ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions
- A memory-reduced RandomX variant for accessible mining
- Analysis of security properties and trade-offs

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Privacy in Cryptocurrencies

Traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin provide pseudonymity but not anonymity. All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, creating a permanent, analyzable transaction graph. Research has demonstrated numerous techniques for deanonymizing users through:

- **Address clustering**: Linking multiple addresses to a single entity
- **Transaction graph analysis**: Tracing fund flows through the network
- **Timing analysis**: Correlating transactions with network activity
- **Amount fingerprinting**: Tracking unique transaction amounts

### 2.2 Privacy Technologies

**Mixing Services**: Early attempts at privacy used mixing services to obscure transaction paths. These suffer from:
- Centralization and trust requirements
- Limited anonymity set
- Vulnerability to timing analysis

**Zerocash/Zcash**: Zero-knowledge proofs provide strong privacy guarantees but require:
- Trusted setup ceremony
- Significant computational overhead
- Complex cryptography

**CryptoNote/Monero**: Ring signatures and stealth addresses provide practical privacy:
- No trusted setup
- Reasonable computational requirements
- Proven track record

ShadowCoin builds on the CryptoNote approach while improving accessibility.

### 2.3 Mining Centralization

Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies face centralization pressure from:
- ASIC development for specific algorithms
- Economies of scale in mining operations
- Geographic concentration near cheap electricity

CPU-friendly algorithms like RandomX help maintain decentralization, but high memory requirements (2+ GB) still favor large operations.

---

## 3. Cryptographic Primitives

### 3.1 Elliptic Curve Cryptography

ShadowCoin uses the Ed25519 elliptic curve, providing:
- 128-bit security level
- Fast signature generation and verification
- Resistance to timing attacks

**Key Operations:**
```
Key generation: (sk, pk) where pk = sk·G
Point addition: P + Q
Scalar multiplication: k·P
```

### 3.2 Hash Functions

**SHA-3 (Keccak-256)**: Primary hash function
- Cryptographically secure
- 256-bit output
- Resistance to length extension attacks

**Blake2b**: Used in proof-of-work
- Fast hashing performance
- Suitable for memory-hard constructions

### 3.3 Pedersen Commitments

Pedersen commitments enable hiding values while proving relationships:

```
C(a, b) = a·G + b·H
```

Properties:
- **Hiding**: Computationally infeasible to determine a from C
- **Binding**: Computationally infeasible to find (a', b') ≠ (a, b) with same commitment
- **Additive homomorphism**: C(a₁, b₁) + C(a₂, b₂) = C(a₁+a₂, b₁+b₂)

---

## 4. Privacy Mechanisms

### 4.1 Ring Signatures

Ring signatures allow signing on behalf of a group without revealing which member signed.

**Properties:**
- **Anonymity**: Signer identity hidden within ring
- **Unforgeability**: Only ring member can produce valid signature
- **Linkability**: Same signer using same key produces linked signatures

**MLSAG Construction:**

ShadowCoin implements Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signatures:

1. Signer selects real output and n-1 decoys
2. Forms ring R = {P₀, P₁, ..., Pₙ₋₁}
3. Computes key image I = x·Hₚ(Pπ) where π is secret index
4. Generates signature proving knowledge of discrete log for one ring member

**Security Analysis:**

With ring size n:
- Anonymity set: n possible signers
- Probability of guessing correct signer: 1/n
- Multiple inputs multiply anonymity sets

Recommended ring size of 11 provides reasonable anonymity while maintaining efficiency.

### 4.2 Stealth Addresses

Stealth addresses prevent address reuse and output linking:

**Address Generation:**
1. User generates spend keypair (a, A) and view keypair (b, B)
2. Publishes address containing (A, B)

**Payment Protocol:**
1. Sender generates random r
2. Computes one-time public key: P = Hₛ(r·B, i)·G + A
3. Publishes (P, R) where R = r·G

**Receiving:**
1. Recipient scans for outputs using view key
2. Computes shared secret: Hₛ(b·R, i)
3. Derives spend key: x = Hₛ(b·R, i) + a

**Properties:**
- Each payment uses unique address
- Only recipient can identify their outputs
- Sender cannot link multiple payments to same user

### 4.3 Ring Confidential Transactions

RingCT hides transaction amounts while proving validity.

**Amount Commitments:**

Each output commits to amount a with blinding factor x:
```
C = a·G + x·H
```

**Range Proofs:**

Bulletproofs prove committed value lies in [0, 2⁶⁴) without revealing amount:

- Logarithmic proof size: 64 bits → ~675 bytes
- Batch verification support
- No trusted setup required

**Zero-Sum Proof:**

Transaction validity requires:
```
Σ C_inputs = Σ C_outputs + fee·G
```

This ensures no coins are created or destroyed without revealing individual amounts.

**ECDH Amount Recovery:**

Amounts encrypted to recipient using Diffie-Hellman:
```
shared_secret = 8·r·A (sender)
shared_secret = 8·a·R (receiver)

encrypted_amount = amount ⊕ H(shared_secret, "amount")
```

Only recipient with view key can decrypt amounts.

---

## 5. Transaction Structure

### 5.1 Transaction Components

A ShadowCoin transaction consists of:

**Inputs:**
- Amount commitment (or 0 for RingCT)
- Ring members (references to previous outputs)
- Key image (prevents double-spending)
- Ring signature

**Outputs:**
- Amount commitment (or 0 for RingCT)
- One-time public key
- Encrypted amount (ECDH)

**Additional Data:**
- Transaction public key
- Range proofs (Bulletproofs)
- Extra field (payment IDs, etc.)

### 5.2 Transaction Flow

**Creation:**
1. Select outputs to spend (inputs)
2. Select ring members for each input
3. Generate one-time addresses for recipients
4. Compute amount commitments
5. Generate range proofs
6. Create ring signatures
7. Broadcast transaction

**Verification:**
1. Verify ring signatures
2. Check key images not previously used
3. Verify range proofs
4. Check commitment sum equals zero (plus fee)
5. Validate transaction structure

### 5.3 Fee Structure

Minimum fee based on transaction size:
```
fee = (tx_size_bytes / 1024) × fee_per_kb
```

Default fee: 0.1 SHD per kilobyte

**Fee Privacy:**

Fees are publicly visible (necessary for miners) but don't compromise privacy:
- Multiple inputs/outputs obscure fee source
- Common fee values reduce uniqueness
- Fee doesn't reveal sender or receiver

---

## 6. Blockchain Architecture

**Advantages:**
- Parallel transaction verification
- Pruning spent outputs
- Natural for ring signatures

### 6.3 Supply Schedule

Total supply: 100,000,000 SHD

**Emission Schedule:**

| Block Range | Reward | Total Emitted |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 0 - 1,049,999 | 50.0 | 52,500,000 |
| 1,050,000 - 2,099,999 | 25.0 | 78,750,000 |
| 2,100,000 - 3,149,999 | 12.5 | 91,875,000 |
| 3,150,000 - 4,199,999 | 6.25 | 98,437,500 |
| 4,200,000+ | 3.125 | → 100,000,000 |
